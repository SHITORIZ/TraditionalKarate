			<p> Hello my name is Scott and I have trained in Shito Ryu Karate-Do for almost 6 years now.  Although bruce lee as not a Karate specific martial artist watching him and learning about him is what got me interested in the first place.  I train under my Sensei Miguel Villalobos Hanshi 8th dan who trained under his Sensei, Grand Master Kenzo Mabuni(1927-2005) the son of the founder Kenwa Mabuni(1889-1952). I have used the art and its training to better my skills not only in the dojo(Place of training), but also at work and in college. One of Traditonal Karate's ultimate goals is to help improve one's character as a human being.  Ultimately my faith in Jesus Christ has been the core of that development but karate also helped.  I compete internationally all over the world, and so far have competed in Canada, USA, and Osaka Japan in the World Championships.  I love the art and how it transforms your mind, body, and spirt.  I will give you a brief video of karate which will also demonstrate the applications of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karate_kata" target="_blank">Kata</a> as well as some quotes from a few founders below.</p>

			<p>"A kata is not fixed or immoveable. Like water, it's ever changing and fits itself to the shape of the vessel containing it. However, kata are not some kind of beautiful competitive dance, but a grand martial art of self-defense - which determines life and death.Do not fall into the trap of thinking that just because a kata begins to the left that the opponent is attacking from the left."--<a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenwa_Mabuni" target="_blank">Kenwa Mabuni(Founder of Shito Ryu Karate.</a> </p>

			<p>"True karate is this: that in daily life one's mind and body be trained and developed in a spirit of humility, and that in critical times, one be devoted utterly to the cause of justice."<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gichin_Funakoshi" target="_blank">--Gichin Funakoshi(Founder of Shotokan Karate)</a></p>
